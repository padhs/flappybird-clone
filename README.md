# flappybird-clone

This is yet another Flappy Bird clone but without the annoying and obnoxious sound effects!(BTW, Who wants to listen to those??)
You are free to fork and clone this repo.

This project creates the classic bird flying to escape the pipes coming its way.
Created this project using libGDx game engine in Android-studio.

Feel free to make changes and request a push to this repo.

This is my first project and my aim was to get to know the "work-around" of coding a simple 2D-game along with its underlying logic. I'm a beginner, so don't expect to see mind-numbing codes! Its pretty easy to understand.
